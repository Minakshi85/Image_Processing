# Implementing the Image Processing Filters
The following is a list of features that you need to implement (listed roughly from easiest to hardest). Refer to the 
http://bit.ly/2IXuKjS for more details on the implementation of each filter and example output images.

## Luminance Operations
### Brightness : Change the brightness of an image by scaling RGB values by a factor.
### Contrast : Change the contrast of an image using the method described
in http://bit.ly/2wWVtrQ. 

## Linear Filtering Operations
### Blur : Blur an image by convolving it with a Gaussian low - pass filter.
### Sharpen : Apply a linear sharpening filter to the image.
### Edge detect : Detect edges in an image by convolving it with an edge detection kernel.

## Resampling Operations
### Scale : Scale an image up or down in resolution by a real valued factor.

## Composite Operations
### Composite :Compose one image with a second image using the over operator, with a third image as a matte (alpha)
